# üç£ Danny's Diner Data Analysis üçú

<img src="1.png" alt="Danny's Logo" width="350"/>

## Introduction

Danny loves Japanese food and, at the beginning of 2021, opened a restaurant selling sushi, curry, and ramen. He needs help using customer data to improve his business.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants insights on customer visiting patterns, spending, and favorite menu items to enhance the customer experience and decide on expanding the loyalty program.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

## Datasets

Danny has provided three key datasets for this case study:

1. **üõí sales**: Captures all customer-level purchases with corresponding order dates and product information.
2. **üìã menu**: Maps the product ID to the actual product name and price of each menu item.
3. **üéüÔ∏è members**: Captures the join date when a customer joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.
